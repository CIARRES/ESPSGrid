# Recommended Setup

In our experiments, the physical layer simulation was conducted on a Windows 10 computer running Simulink. The execution of Docker containers was distributed across two Raspberry Pi devices, which were connected to the computer via a physical router. This setup enables efficient communication and emulation of IEDs.

Alternatively, experiments can also be performed using Ubuntu as the platform for running the Simulink physical layer simulation in conjunction with IED emulation.
